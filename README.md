## The project will discover how to communicate between two processes

### Description

The minitalk project discover how to create a communication between two terminals like a client and server architecture. For that we used __signal.h__ library. 

### Mandatory

- Produce `server` & `client` mini architecture
- `client` must communicate a string passed as a parameter to `server`
- We can only use 2 default signals: `SIGUSR1` AND `SIGUSR2`
